      'Joel joined a new demo team that was assembled quickly in January, 2019 and assigned to me. We were fortunate to have a number of people with complementary skills, which was critical for us as we had to come up with a high quality, repeatable, and sustainable set of processes and standards for the demos we were building. Joel was huge for us as he was our most seasoned front-end developer and had the best eye for design. Joel was instrumental in coming up with a visually attractive and usable design template that we used for all our demos, and in establishing a set of design practices. It was a pleasure to work with Joel, and I strongly recommend him.',

His contributions transcend his stellar coding abilities; he has also played a crucial role in strategic planning and innovation, ensuring our projects are aligned with business objectives while setting standards for optimal user experience. Joel's impact on our team and products has been profound. He is not only an asset to any team from a technical standpoint but also brings a level of enthusiasm and innovation that elevates those around him.
